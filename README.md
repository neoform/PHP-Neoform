PHP Neoform - PHP Framwork
----------------------

PHP Neoform is not a CMS. PHP Neoform is not wordpress. PHP Neoform is not a framework that does everything for you.

PHP Neoform is a framework that facilitates the creation of very well organized, easy to work with code that runs very efficiently. Unlike most frameworks out there, phpCore will not get in your way. It is extremely flexible and extremely fast. This of course comes at a cost, it means this is not a framework for non-programmers, sorry. The only backend interfaces you're going to get are the ones you create. That said, making one is not difficult at all.

## Features

* **Very efficient and accurate caching:** Most other open source PHP frameworks treat caching as an afterthought. phpCore was built with caching as its main priority. Instead of caching an entire query's result set, each record is stored individually in cache. This means any time a record is changed, only that record gets removed from cache. This means the framework will **never** serve expired/dirty cache.
* **MVC** an easy to use model view controller setup that allows a great deal of flexibility in URLs.
* **Multi-language support** the built in locale tools allow not only for easy translation of content, but also multi language URLs.
* **Strong authentication** the built in authentication is fast, efficient and secure. All passwords are salted and hashed using industry standard techniques.
